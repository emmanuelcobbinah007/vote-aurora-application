/**
 * Integration Demo Component
 *
 * This component demonstrates how to integrate the Election Details system
 * with the existing Elections Page. In a real implementation:
 *
 * 1. The ElectionsPage would have a "View Details" or "Manage" button
 * 2. Clicking that button would navigate to /superadmin/elections/[electionId]
 * 3. The election details page would fetch data from the API
 * 4. All CRUD operations would make actual API calls
 *
 * For this demo, we're showing both components and the navigation between them.
