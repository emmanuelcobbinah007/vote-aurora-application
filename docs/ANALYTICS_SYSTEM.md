# Analytics System Documentation

## Overview

The University E-Voting System includes a comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides detailed insights into election performance, voter turnout, and candidate results. The analytics system is built with a component-based architecture using React, TypeScript, and Recharts for data visualization.

## System Architecture

### Two-Tier Analytics Structure

1. **Overall Analytics Dashboard** (`/analytics`)

   - Provides system-wide election insights
   - Shows summary statistics across all elections
   - Displays election status distribution
   - Tracks overall voter turnout trends

2. **Individual Election Analytics** (`/analytics/[electionId]`)
   - Detailed analytics for specific elections
   - Portfolio-wise results breakdown
   - Real-time voting trends
   - Candidate performance analysis

## Features

- Candidate performance metrics
- Vote counts and percentages
- Winner identification

## Data Models

### Core Analytics Types

```typescript
interface AnalyticsData {
  id: string;
  election_id: string;
  portfolio_id: string;
  candidate_id: string;
  votes_count: number;
  percentage: number;
  updated_at: string;
  // Relationships
  election: Election;
  portfolio: Portfolio;
  candidate: Candidate;
}

interface ElectionSummary {
  election: Election;
  totalVotes: number;
  totalVoters: number;
  turnoutPercentage: number;
  portfoliosCount: number;
  candidatesCount: number;
  status: string;
}

interface CandidateAnalytics {
  candidate: Candidate;
